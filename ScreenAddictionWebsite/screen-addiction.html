      <h3>What is screen addiction?&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>Do you or your child easily succumb to the glow of a screen, or the chirp of a newly arrived text? If you do, then you are part of one of the most significant cultural phenomenons in human history – screen addiction.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When you offer two hours of screen time and that two hours is up, and whining and complaining ensue… your children may be addicted. If children fight over and cannot agree on a movie to watch, screen time addiction may be present. When your children consistently ask or try to bargain for more screen time, your children may be addicted to the screen. When your children have poor attitudes and often fight with one another, this, too, can be caused by too much screen time.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
