			<li><strong>Personal background:</strong> I was born in New York but my family moved to Charlotte when I was still very young. I live in Indian Land, SC now but my family all lives relatively close to one another so we see each other all the time. My sister and I are very close in age and have similar interests she's basically my best friend. I have the sweetest bunny named Lilah who we rescued from the animal shelter at 9 years old. <br> My favorite thing to do in my spare time is to hang out with friends and explore the city. I also love to play video games, read books, do makeup, go to the gym and travel.</li><br>
			<li><strong>Professional background:</strong> I worked at Marshalls as a full-time employee for about a year until I was promoted to the shoe department coordinator. I worked there for about two more years until I became a shift lead at Marco's Pizza. I now work at Panera Bread part-time while I'm in school.</li><br>
			<li><strong>Academic background:</strong> I graduated high school in 2013 and started taking college classes the next year. i took two years of classes and then had to put my education on hold so I could focus on working for a while. I just completed all three of my cerificate programs at CPCC and am currently working my way through some udemy and codecademy classes.</li><br>
			<li><strong>Background in the subject matter of this course:</strong> My dad works as an architect for NTT Data so I'm very familiar with the things involved in web development He's very excited about me pursuing it as a career!</li><br>
			<li><strong>Primary computer platform:</strong> Windows 10</li><br>
			<li><strong>Interesting fact about yourself:</strong> Legally my last name is Massi but if it hadn't been changed a generation or two ago it would be Maschiarelli. I'm not exactly sure how but I am related to movie screenwriter Garry Marshall and actress Penny Marshall who's family also decided to ditch the Maschiarelli name.</li><br>
